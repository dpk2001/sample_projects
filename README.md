# This repo contains the following sample code:

## ai_text_detection:

This sample helps to identify AI generated text by using a dataset with both Human created and AI generated texts

First, run text_real_vs_fake_make_data.py to generate GPT processed last hidden states for subsequent processing by classifier in text_real_vs_fake.ipynb

## fake_face_detection:

This sample helps to identify AI generated faces by using a dataset with both real and AI generated faces

All the code is contained in face_real_vs_fake_small.ipynb and face_real_vs_fake_tiny.ipynb, which differ in the size of the model used
